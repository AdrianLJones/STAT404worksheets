Worksheet for stat 404 done as homework after doing most of it in class

Question #1)
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
ecoli <- read.table("ecoli_cows.txt", header = T)
as.matrix(ecoli) #do this so we can do matrix algebra with it
ecoli
```

 1a) x6,1 is -1
 1b) x3,2 is -1
 1c) y7 is --37
 1d) e7 is unknown because we don't have betas yet to estimate it from the observed


Doing the linear model by hand using matrix algebra

Question #2)

```{r}
y <- ecoli[,3]
x <- cbind(rep(1,12), ecoli[,1], ecoli[,2], ecoli[,1]*ecoli[,2])

```
We now have the observed vector y and the expanded design matrix x.


Question #3)

```{r}
xtx <- t(x) %*% x
xty <- t(x) %*% y

xtx

```
xtx is usefull because it is orthogonal.  This happened because it was made with an equal number of experimental units for all possible treatment combinations


Question #4)
```{r}
betaHat <- solve(xtx) %*% xty

betaHat

```

Question #5)
```{r}
lmEcoli=lm(EColiCount~carcassWash*sprayChill, data=ecoli)
summary(lmEcoli)

```

At the 99.9% ci I can reject eh Ho that beta1 = 0

Question #6)
